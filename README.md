## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch sorting algorithms as they animate step-by-step.
- **Live Demo**: Access a fully functional version of the visualizer online.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Built with core web technologies, making it lightweight and easy to understand.

## Algorithms Implemented

Currently, the visualizer supports the **Bubble Sort** algorithm. More algorithms can be added in the future.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using the following technologies:

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For the sorting logic and animation.
